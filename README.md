No seriously, what is it?
-------------------------------------------------
Planemo is basically a [static code analysis tool][11] written in [Dart programming language][12]. Its main goal is to read everything in given directory (and recursively downwards) and
checks any found file (no matter if its its .js, .css, .html or whatever) and its contents against a set of rules, configurable by the user.

The whole idea is that Planemo should help your project to maintain [coding conventions][13], [best practices][14] and other fun rules your software project might have, for any source code file or language.

Currently it has a lot of available built in plugins to choose from, but it also super easy to write your own plugin and even contribute it back to the project.

Fun fact #184: The word *Planemo* comes from *[planetary-mass object][15]*!
